# jupyter-clojure
A Docker image for a Jupyter notebook with a Clojure kernel

This image uses the [clj-jupyter](https://github.com/achesnais/clj-jupyter) Clojure kernel developed by [Antoine Chesnais](https://github.com/achesnais).

See also [jupyter-clojure-docker](https://github.com/kxxoling/jupyter-clojure-docker) for a similar approach using a different Clojure kernel.
